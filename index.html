            <h3>Design & Development</h3>
            <p> Coding is very interesting and it was one of the reason I choose to study computeer science in the university, 
              it's fascinating to me how people design stuff with the system, write code to execute task,
              and still tells you computer only understands 0's and 1's. I decided to write my own code to solve tasks.

          <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
          <p>What interest me most about solving problem is that, you don't need to know the answer to all
            problems, you only need to know how to get the answer to all problemS.This will require you
            to think outside the box, by asking yourself the right questions and providing the right answers,
            then you will be able to solve the riddles and help people with your solution.
            <em><b>The key is to know the HOW?</b></em>
